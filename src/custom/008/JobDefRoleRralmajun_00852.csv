3,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_100_010","Welcome! I know you may have reservations about our plan to infiltrate the Passage of the Unbound, but I promise you, your actions could save countless lives!"
4,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_150_010","Welcome! If there are any details you'd like to confirm about the Passage of the Unbound's wicked plan, I should be glad to share all I can."
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_200_010","Well, if it isn't my favorite customer! Thanks to you, the world is free from the Passage of the Unbound's villainy. If there's anything I can do for you, you need only say the word!"

7,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_A1_000_021","How are things?"
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_A1_000_022","Tell me about the sacred treasures."

10,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_A1_000_024","Nothing."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_030","They could be better, I confess. The thieves are still at large, and each clan has sent one of their own to track them down. One of your varied talents would be of great help, should you be willing to lend your aid."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_031","As you well know, the treasures have all been recovered. The entirety of Tural─and the world, no doubt─is in your debt!"
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_032","Even so, the Passage of the Unbound consisted of six members. Although most of them have been accounted for, we can't say for sure that the threat they posed is gone for good."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_033","If we catch wind of any foul plots, we'll spread word at once. Stop by once in a while and we'll share all we know─and of course, you're welcome as an honored patron any time! "
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_060","Thanks to your efforts, the five leaders of the Passage of the Unbound are in custody. But so long as the founder Apyaahi remains free, there is the danger she might rebuild and plot again."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_061","By infiltrating her organization, you may be able to uncover her future schemes before they come to fruition, thereby allowing us to prevent further suffering!"
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_100_061","Thank goodness you uncovered Apyaahi's plot to attack Tuliyollal! If only we had more definite details, we might better prepare..."

アパーヒの次なる攻撃目標はトライヨラだとか！"
19,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_063","With not only her enforcers but now an army of beasts under her command, the fighting will be fierce. Thankfully, the Landsguard have pledged their help! Please, strike back together and drive the Passage of the Unbound from our home!"
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_064","Tuliyollal is safe, and we have you and our dear allies to thank for it! You're welcome to all the tacos your stomach can hold!"
21,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_065","首領に加え、残党である幹部2期生たちも無事に逮捕されました。
これでホントのホントに「自由の扉」は壊滅、

22,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_040","They are objects of incredible power, passed down through generations to clans hailing from all corners of Tural."
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_041","Within each is sealed the essence of an animal which became a fearsome tural vidraal, and these have come to be revered by their respective peoples."
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_042","These treasures allow their wielder to harness the power of the beast within them, and thus have the clans protected their homes."
25,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_043","But the origins of these relics are shrouded in mystery. None know who made them, or why. The answer to some questions has simply been lost to time, I suppose..."
26,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_044","If Apyaahi is to be believed, the treasures were created by an individual of the Yok Huy. Luckily, it seems she possesses the last one, so if you can bring her down, we need no longer fear that they will be misused!"
27,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_045","If Apyaahi is to be believed, the treasures were created by a Yok Huy calling himself the Wise One. And now that hers has been destroyed, we need no longer fear that they will be misused!"
28,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_050","What did that Apyaahi call it, again? Oh, yes, a “secretive, villainous order,” and of that I've no doubt. The six of them sat right over there and didn't order a single thing the whole time!"
29,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_051","Apyaahi seemed to be their self-styled leader, and claimed their goals were to sow discord throughout the world and make its nations crumble in the process. Stealing the treasures was only a means to this end, it seems."
30,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_052","They succeeded in their initial goal, and have since fled back across the sea. However, it would appear that each thief has retreated to a different destination."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_053","The retrieval of the treasures is paramount, both to bring peace to these troubled peoples and to quell the threat of further evil! "
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_054","The Landsguard told me why Apyaahi founded her villainous organization. And what a story it is...a trivial, ridiculous story."
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_055","Thankfully, without the treasures to rely upon, the Passage of the Unbound has no teeth. No doubt the authorities of nations across the star will root out the remaining members─though I expect the organization will fade into obscurity soon enough regardless."
34,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_056","...Or so I had thought, until more leaders gathered in this very place!"
35,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLERRALMAJUN_00852_RRALMAJUN_000_057","Fortunately, they were apprehended almost immediately. Never again shall that abominable group trouble us... Never!"
