1,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_Q1_000_000","What will you ask about?"
2,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_A1_000_001","Tell me about yourself."

11,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_001","I was a researcher's assistant in charge of filing documents at the Archeion. When I learned of the Cosmic Exploration Initiative, I knew at once that I wished to take part─to lend my expertise to the cause."
12,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_002","And I'm not the only one. You'll find many of those here are scholars who previously had a hand in planning the great exodus. Surprisingly, the work is scarcely any different."
13,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_003","Of course, I never dared dream that I would travel to the moon and meet the Loporrits! Scarcely a dull moment around here, and no shortage of friendly faces besides."
14,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_004","Sinus Ardorum is what we call this crater we occupy. Believe it or not, we've got a fairly stable living environment nestled in here."
15,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_005","They say that Namingway dreamt up the name and its meaning. Fitting, considering he did the same for countless landmarks in Mare Lamentorum some thousand years ago."
16,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_006","For a blessing, this place has ready access to stellar currents, making it an ideal port to harbor a starship! I'm told they're akin to the aetherial currents you might find back home."
17,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_007","The Cosmoor is the central sector of Sinus Ardorum where the Moongate Hub is situated. It's our gateway into space!"
18,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_008","Here you'll find facilities like the Lunar Hopopolis, the cosmoports, and the crew's habitation modules. Lately it's starting to feel like a little village, almost..."
19,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_009","You know, if our interstellar expeditions continue far into the future, perhaps one day this place will grow into a proper thriving harbor! I'd love to see it."
20,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_010","Calabash Cove is a smaller crater in the northwest sector of Sinus Ardorum, named for the bottle gourd shape of the local reservoir."
21,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_011","Nearly all of the moon's spring water is tainted with poisonous aetherochemicals, mind you, but luckily our rainbow crystal purifies that sort of thing."
22,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_012","We've documented rock formations rich in corrupted crystal clusters nearby─and they're slowly growing. Under the surface, the aetheric currents could very well be unstable."
23,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_013","Seen the bright pink moss, have you? It's an experimental garden designed to explore the unique attributes of a lunar ecosystem."
24,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_014","There's also an aetherochemical pool in the area that we call Palus Arsenici─the “marsh of arsenic.” It may look pretty, but that doesn't make it safe to play in."
25,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_015","Yet the native flora seem to thrive regardless... Have they the ability to filter the contaminants from the water? One of many things we're investigating!"
26,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_016","Gleamslope is a smaller crater ensconced in a mountainous crystalline formation in the southwest sector of Sinus Ardorum. You can enter it through Piercingway Tunnel."
27,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_017","Inside, we've found debris seemingly Allagan in origin─and if our theory holds, it's connected to the Heimdall in Mare Lamentorum."
28,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_018","Perhaps the vessel broke into scattered pieces as it crashed? Incredible to think the effects of the Seventh Umbral Calamity rippled as far as the moon..."
29,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_019","You've seen that canyon to the northeast, I take it? The lunar nadir refers to the cavern at the bottom. Just ride the nadir lift down to reach it!"
30,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_020","It's like a whole different world down there. Jagged crystal clusters, spots of fungi growing all over the place, not to mention the aetherial falls..."
31,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_021","That sort of isolated environment is ripe for experimentation, so we're planning a few tests. With any luck, the data may prove useful on other stars!"
32,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_022","You'll have to be more specific! The hub has everything a settlement needs─power, water, you name it. Every facility here is controlled by the rainbow crystal."
33,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_023","This technology is truly first-rate─a perfect marriage of Loporrit magicks and Sharlayan brilliance! Every parameter is recorded automatically to improve efficiency."
34,"TEXT_CTSWKS72MOONGATEHUB_00934_WHISPERINGWILLOW_000_024","Perhaps one day we'll have the means to predict what environments await us on other stars. Until then, there's much to be learned from the data we acquire here!"
