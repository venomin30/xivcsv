※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_01","Astrid marks a few areas on your map where you are to perform the embodiment of love for any who appear in need of encouragement. Taking a deep breath as you steel yourself for a day of bestowing ardor and affection with this newfound gesture, you set off.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_02","Though the audacious pose understandably took lovelorn Gridanians by surprise, it also proved effective in inspiring them to act on their feelings. With the deed done, it is time you returned to Astrid at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
3,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_03","Whilst you and Emilie report your experiences with performing the pose to Astrid, a distraught Lisette stumbles into your midst, claiming to have found Hortefense meeting with a secret lover. Astrid, rather doubtful of this assertion, urges Lisette to be brave and confront her betrothed about the matter. Finding courage in the heart ever adorned on her cheek─a symbol of her great-grandmother, the Countess Arabelle─Lisette storms off to show Hortefense the error of his alleged ways. Worried for her sister, Astrid asks you and Emilie to follow after her to the Carline Canopy."
4,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_04","You find Lisette standing before Hortefense and a young woman, struggling to express herself. After offering her a word of encouragement, she at last demands her beau to explain his actions. Before he can, however, the young woman reveals that she had merely sought Hortefense's advise with courting an individual she had her eye on. Surprised, yet relieved, Lisette performs the embodiment of love for the maiden, telling her to follow her heart. With the misunderstanding resolved, Emilie suggests you both return to Astrid, who is undoubtedly eager to learn of how matters fared."
5,"TEXT_FESVLX002_04809_SEQ_05","Thanking you for supporting her sister, Astrid expresses her joy that the embodiment of love has raised interest in the symbol of the festival─the heart. Full of hope that more and more folk will come to learn of its history and the story of its creator, she wishes you the happiest of Valentione's Days, performing at last her own adorable rendition of the embodiment of love."
