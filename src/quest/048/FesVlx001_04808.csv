※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLX001_04808_SEQ_01","In need of a helping hand, Astrid de Valentione, head emissary of the Valentione's Day celebrations, asks that you fetch the apprentice emissary Emilie, who has been preparing a mysterious surprise for the day's festivities. Being the chivalrous soul that you are, you happily oblige.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLX001_04808_SEQ_02","As told, you find Emilie practicing in a spot of shade not a stone's throw from Fen–Yll Fineries. Should you wish to find out what she was practicing, she insists you return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
3,"TEXT_FESVLX001_04808_SEQ_03","Astrid thanks you for retrieving Emilie, who is now ready to reveal her surprise. And indeed, a look of astonishment briefly rests upon your face when she at last performs the so-called “Embodiment of Love.” Explaining that she hoped this bold expression of affection would inspire others to act on their feelings, Astrid is of a mind to have you both display the gesture before the townsfolk─if not for the fact that it would be an arduous task without a third pair of hands. With perfect timing, Lisette de Valentione enters the stage, offering to lend her assistance. Your numbers thus buoyed, Astrid asks that you speak with her when you are ready to begin."
