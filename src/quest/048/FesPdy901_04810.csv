※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_01","Little Ladies' Day soon approaches, but its arrival is heralded by someone most unexpected: Jihli Aliapoh, who claims to have had a dream of a goobbue on Ul'dah's grand stage. Before making this dream come true, however, she must convince the planners of Little Ladies' Day that the goobue performer she hired poses no danger to the people. The royal seneschal has traveled from Ul'dah on behalf of his peers, and Aliapoh instructs you to go to Bentbranch Meadows, where the goobue is delivering joy to all and sundry.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_02","As promised, Aldemund and Peatie, his goobbue companion, are ready and eager to perform their show. After seeing the mild-mannered goobbue turn an egg into a rabbit, the royal seneschal is convinced that the pair would be right at home in Little Ladies' Day. They must finished the event in Gridania first, however, and for that Aldemund requires your aid. It seems Peatie suffers from a minor case of stage fright, and Aldemund asks that you ride on the goobbue's head to reassure her as she performs for the crowds across Gridania. Peatie stands at the ready, with no obvious signs of disagreement to the idea of having you atop her head."
3,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_03","Peatie shwos no sign of discontent as you mount her head. Now, the people of Gridania await to find out the answer to the question “What's in the egg?”"
4,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_04","Peatie's performance is a hit across Gridania, and the spirit of Hatching–tide is alive and well within the city. Aldemund is surely eager to hear of his friend's success, and perhaps requires a few helping hands to pass out what eggs remain."
5,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_05","You arrive to see Aldemund's supply of eggs to be empty─a true sign that Peatie's show acheived everything it set out to do. The Little Ladies' Day planners are sure to accept her now, but it comes down to the decision of the royal seneschal."

55,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_015","This year, it was again a dream that sparked my imagination...a dream of a goobbue, massive and marvelous, standing upon the stage. And where was that stage, you ask? It might surprise you to hear that it was in Ul'dah, so many malms away!"

84,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_053","Aye, that we do. You'll be hard-pressed to pick your jaw up off the floor after you see what my Peatie has in store for you."
85,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_054","I've been watchin' over her ever since the day I found her wanderin' the wilderness all by her lonesome. We spent ages lookin' for her family, but now I s'pose were all each other has."
86,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_BUTLER_000_055","Peatie? A lovely name, to be sure. And those flowers, are they peach blossoms? Ah, she looks the very symbol of Little Ladies' Day!"
87,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_056","Haha, I'm glad to hear that, and I know Peatie is, too. She's thought of little else since the moment Miss Aliapoh came to us with her peculiar request."

90,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_059","Impressive, ain't it? Usin' nothin' but a glamour prism, we change one of these ornate eggs into a cuddly little rabbit. Seems a fittin' show for the season."
91,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_061","And while our materials are simple, this idea only came to us after days and nights of wrackin' our brains. Wasn't easy to capture the spirit of <Emphasis>two</Emphasis> celebrations."
92,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_062","Now here comes the rub. Ever since we arrived in Gridania, Peatie's been a little on edge. Hate to see her like this, but I think I've figured out what's causin' it."
93,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_063","As you just saw, she's got no problem performin' in front of a crowd of two. But when a whole gaggle of revelers showed up not too long ago, she just froze up."
94,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_BUTLER_000_064","I see... She must not be used to such large crowds."
95,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_065","Luckily I managed to save the show by climbin' atop her head. That set her mind at ease, and finally she was able to tell rabbit from egg."
96,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_100_065","But I ain't as young as I used to be, and my knees aren't up to the task of climbin' her more than once in a blue moon."
97,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_066","But you, on the other hand...I reckon you've got plenty of malms left in those adventurer's legs of yours. Might I trouble you to join our merry troupe and support Peatie durin' her star turn?"
98,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_ALDEMUND_000_067","All you have to do is climb atop her and head toward the crowds. Do our “What's in the egg?” act, and tell the spectators to come to me for an egg of their own. Still plenty to go around."
99,"TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_BUTLER_000_070","If Peatie's act is a hit in Gridania, then I see no reason why anyone would object to having her in Ul'dah. Best of luck, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
