※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_01","The royal seneschal appears to be Peatie's biggest fan, and he invites both her and Aldemund to Ul'dah, that Peatie might be the star attraction of this year's Little Ladies' Day. He requests your assistance in comforting Peatie as she gets used to to the crowds, then departs to Ul'dah to make preparations for her arrival. Aldemund and Peatie have business to attend to in Gridania before they follow, so the performer asks you to go ahead and await their arrival.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_02","The royal seneschal informs you that the planning committee for Little Ladies' Day has agreed to welcome Peatie with open arms, and now he asks you to help do what you can to spread the same sentiment among the city's populace. He bids you travel to the Steps of Thal and do what you can to drum up interest in the coming entertainment."
3,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_03","While not everyone you speak with is accepting of a goobbue in their city at first, you manage to convince all three citizens you speak with to attend the show, and some even seem excited at the prospect. Who knows how many more they might convince to attend Peatie's performance? All that is left is to visit the stage and report your success to the royal seneschal."
4,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_04","You arrive at the stage in Emerald Avenue to see a crowd much larger than the one in Gridania, all waiting to be entertained. It seems the presence of so many expectant guests has caused Peatie to freeze up, but Aldemund suggests <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>rallying<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> her spirits to shake her out of this fluster."
5,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_05","Although Peatie is initially too frightened to respond to your encouragement, a few heartfelt words manages to break her loose from the clutches of fear and gives her a newfound sense of determination. With the goobbue ready for her big show, all thta is left is for you to join the crowd and cheer for your friend from afar."
6,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_06","Peatie takes the stage and her show dazzles all present, earning the goobbue a hearty applause. As she leaves the stage, you sense a feeling of contentment and pride in Peatie's inscrutable expression. The royal seneschal, however, is more obviously ecstatic with the reaction, and seems eager to thank you for your part in bringing it about. "
7,"TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_07","All present are proud of Peatie's success, but perhaps she is the proudest of all. Realizing that Peatie is meant to keep on this road and that his best days as a performer are behind him, Aldemund asks that you take his goobbue companion along on your adventures. As you look forward to keeping the company of a famous goobbue, the royal seneschal and Jihli Aliapoh both encourage you to enjoy their respective celebrations. With so much merrymaking across the realm, smiles will be guaranteed for moons to come."
