1,"TEXT_KINGMH106_05304_SEQ_01","Shale informs you that she has secured passage to the foundation sector, and that she will accompany you to gather data on the uncharted area. You and your companions head to the government sector, where the lift to Everkeep's depths is located."
2,"TEXT_KINGMH106_05304_SEQ_02","Your party assembles at the lift, and before you board Shale hands you a communicator. The adapter will use the coordinate data it provides to guide you as you delve into Everkeep's depths, where the old castle is said to be preserved.

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
3,"TEXT_KINGMH106_05304_SEQ_03","After disembarking the lift and pushing through a sandy area crawling with beasts, the former castle of Alexandria comes into sight. You and your allies approach its timeworn doors, only to be assaulted by mechanized guardians, and during the melee you hear the voice of Calyx beckoning you deeper into the castle, where he intends to further test your combat capabilities. Cutting through more foes, you reach a chamber occupied by an ancient but hostile machine, and after a fierce battle you stand victorious. Shale and Sphene catch up, and together you prepare to search the fortress in earnest.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by talking to the lift attendant in the government sector."
4,"TEXT_KINGMH106_05304_SEQ_04","During your exploration of the castle, Sphene reminisces about her time spent there in centuries past─a heartfelt moment interrupted when you both are suddenly transported to a decrepit room. The moldering surroundings are soon replaced by virtual overlays recreating the throne of Alexandria in its former glory. At the center of the chamber are Calyx and the simulant, the former stating that he has one last trial with which to test your mettle, before a hulking mass of metal descends onto the arena. The simulant addresses it as Zelenia, who was second-in-command of Alexandria's royal knights. Overcome with rage at this affront, Sphene begs your aid in destroying the ignoble machine, even though it means you will be playing right into Calyx's hands.

※Recollection can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
5,"TEXT_KINGMH106_05304_SEQ_05","The imitation of Alexandria's finest proves to be a formidable opponent, but yet again you manage to pull through. Calyx seems unperturbed by the destruction of his creation, and appraises you with a look that suggests he possesses knowledge you do not.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the lift attendant in the government sector."
6,"TEXT_KINGMH106_05304_SEQ_06","Calyx reveals that he covets the key that he might use it to harvest aether from reflections to sustain a growing population of Endless, and in so doing facilitate the evolution of mankind. He then states he will bestow upon you a “gift” before ending the transmission and stripping the room of its illusory grandeur, leaving you and Sphene standing before a dilapidated throne, upon which a tiara rests."
7,"TEXT_KINGMH106_05304_SEQ_07","Although Sphene is torn by the reminder of Zelenia's loss, she is grateful for you striking down the creation that disgraced her memory. As you look around the chamber, it remains unclear just how far into the castle's depths you have been thrust..."
