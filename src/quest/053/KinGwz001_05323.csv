0,"TEXT_KINGWZ001_05323_SEQ_00","Where there are idle hands, Mumukko finds ways to fill them."
1,"TEXT_KINGWZ001_05323_SEQ_01","You happen to cross paths with Mumukko, project manager for the Cosmic Exploration Initiative, who insists that you have time to spare. As she explains to you, her job has been made difficult in recent days by certain brilliant but otherwise absent-minded workers who have yet to collect their crew uniforms. Thankfully for Mumukko, you have allegedly volunteered to assist her, and thus are you entrusted with the forgotten articles and a map with which to locate their owners."
2,"TEXT_KINGWZ001_05323_SEQ_02","The first two deliveries are completed without incident. The off-duty gleaner, having joined the initiative in pursuit of more difficult jobs, was mortified at the sight of her uniform, lamenting her mistake as amateurish. The xenobiologist Chrysielle, on the other hand, scarcely blinked at the sight of hers, as her mind is far more fixated on the prospect of proving her theses. Only one suit remains, and according to Mumukko's map, its owner can be found somewhere near the <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis>."
3,"TEXT_KINGWZ001_05323_SEQ_03","The final forgotten crew uniform belongs to none other than Kokkol Dankkol, the eccentric engineer who previously perfected the aetherburner for the <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis>, now promoted to chief propulsion systems engineer for the Cosmic Exploration Initiative. He is delighted to see you─less so the uniform, as he only feels at ease wearing his standard work attire. Mumukko, meanwhile, is unamused by his lax outlook on sanitation. After impressing upon him the importance of preventing contamination of their ship, and any stars upon which it may land, he is eventually cowed into compliance. The engineer then sets off in his new formfitting attire, and Mumukko invites you to return to the Lunar Hopopolis for a reward."
4,"TEXT_KINGWZ001_05323_SEQ_04","Mumukko understands this errand is a matter well below your station, and so she apologizes for the triviality of it all. She believes that strong personalities, such as those drawn to the initiative, can only be corralled by those with strength in equal measure. Grateful for your assistance, she hopes to prevail upon it again in future."
