51,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_SHALE_000_003","They wanted to discuss how to go about treating those afflicted with lightning. Admirable─I don't know how they keep going without so much as a short break."
52,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_010","Before heading out, I should put on more suitable attire. There's a modern outfit among the items Shale has prepared for me, I believe."

55,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_013","Shale said that she chose the outfit herself. Once I've changed, I shall join you outside."
56,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_WUKLAMAT_000_014","Even if she can walk, she's still far from fully recovered. We'll have to take care not to push her too hard."
57,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_015","I haven't gone outside in a while. Shale decrypted more of my mother's records, so I've been spending a lot of time reading them..."
58,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_SHALE_000_020","As long as we keep Sphene's identity under wraps, it should be safe enough to walk around the city."
59,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_SHALE_000_021","Still, we can't be too cautious while the simulant's off doing whatever it is she's doing. Do take care out there."

61,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_RESIDENT05300_000_023","I was! Things were a bit awkward at first─she's still so young, after all─but before long we were talking up a storm. We had so much fun, just like old times!"
62,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_024","So this is Alexandria... Despite being inside a tower, it feels as though I'm out in the open."
63,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_025","And though the sights are nothing like I remember, electrope is still everywhere I look. 'Tis a strange yet familiar place."
64,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_030","That lady wants to talk with Lamaty'i, so while they're busy, I'll tell you about what we can see from here. Is there any place that interests you?"
65,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_031","There are so very many, I can't decide where to begin..."
66,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_032","Then why don't we let <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> choose?"

69,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_040","The lady talking to Lamaty'i just came back from Tuliyollal. It was her first time since being trapped in the barrier thirty years ago. She has family in Alexandria now, so she had to return."
70,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_041","But the train made it safe and easy for her to make the journey, and it's all thanks to everyone's hard work!"
71,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_042","There was once a railroad connecting Alexandria and neighboring Lindblum, but operations were suspended when relations deteriorated. Eventually, the tracks were removed entirely."
72,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_043","To see that a railroad now connects us to our new neighbors is gratifying."
73,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_044","Especially considering that our history began with war─with Alexandria the aggressor. In continuing to strive for peace, Tuliyollal's leaders have shown great magnanimity, and I can't help but be moved."
74,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_045","There are lots of different shops at the Nexus Arcade, selling everything you need. It's always full of people out doing their shopping."
75,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_046","The Endless Sphene gave <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Lamaty'i a tour of the place. I remember watching them from a distance."
76,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_047","The castle town I knew had a main thoroughfare that was lined with shops. Whenever I visited, the citizens would come and speak with me about matters great and small."
77,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_048","Just like that lady is doing now with Wuk Lamat..."
78,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_049","If you attune to leynode nine, you can teleport back here any time you want."
79,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_050","You can also use it to teleport to other locations in Solution Nine. It makes it easy to get around."
80,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_051","That's the mode of travel that utilizes aether currents, yes? We had the same in my time, but when the Storm Surge broke out, such nodes were sealed off to prevent enemy use."
81,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_052","And after the war, the aetheric balance across the entire world had collapsed. Not only was travel outside the barrier ill-advised, the act of teleportation itself had become dangerous. We had to abandon the nodes altogether."
82,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_053","'Tis heartening to see them available again for the use of one and all..."
83,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_054","In the government sector, there's a counter where citizens can get matched to jobs."
84,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_055","There's also a soul exchange, but no one goes there much these days since there aren't many souls in circulation."
85,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_056","I'm unsure how I feel about regulators and the treatment of souls as a resource..."
86,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_057","I understand the grief of those who have lost loved ones, and the desire to escape the sorrow of death."
87,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_058","Even so, I would never wish to forget. My parents, Otis, Zelenia...I want to remember them all. I am reluctant to impose my personal beliefs upon others, though..."
88,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_059","Thanks for your help, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I hope Queen Sphene─er...I mean, <Emphasis>just</Emphasis> Sphene─will feel at home here one day."
89,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_060","The joy of spying stars between faint gaps in the clouds is absent here, but 'tis a fine thing to be sheltered from the thunder and rain."
90,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_WUKLAMAT_000_070","Sorry about that, I got a little carried away with the conversation."
91,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_071","It's alright. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and I told her about the places we can see from here."
92,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_WUKLAMAT_000_072","Really? That's great!"
93,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_WUKLAMAT_000_073","Right then, why don't we stroll through the residential sector and then stop at Mosaic? We can take a break there."
94,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_DELIA_000_074","Welcome to Mosaic. When you're ready to order, just let me know."
95,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_GULOOLJA_000_075","What should I get...?"
96,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_ORIGINALSPHENE_000_076","I understand this café was named for the different races, who appear as a mosaic of colors when they gather here. What an inspired idea."
97,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_WUKLAMAT_000_080","We've been walking for a while, so let's rest our feet, eh? Drinks are on me."
98,"TEXT_KINGMH102_05300_WUKLAMAT_000_081","Sphene, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─the two of you go ahead and order first."
