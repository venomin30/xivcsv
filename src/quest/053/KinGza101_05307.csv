1,"TEXT_KINGZA101_05307_SEQ_01","You find the Cornservant in a most unusual predicament. While normally overeager to tend to the hungry bellies of Tuliyollal, they sense a stomach so ravenous, they dare not approach it alone. In your company, however, they have courage to carry out their duty. Not wishing to press you into action, they humbly await your readiness at the pier."
2,"TEXT_KINGZA101_05307_SEQ_02","Together with the Cornservant, you set off for Bayside Bevy. You can only wonder what manner of famished individual could leave your corny companion feeling so daunted."
3,"TEXT_KINGZA101_05307_SEQ_03","After some concentration, the Cornservant discovers the troubled belly belongs to a seemingly harmless Pelupelu merchant. No sooner do you speak with him, however, than he doubles over, professing a great hunger for blood. While admittedly shocked, the Cornservant immediately understands that the merchant's appetite is not his own and demands the entity responsible to come forth. The true culprit, it turns out, is a sentient dagger.

The Cornservant explains that such tools were once used for ritual sacrifices performed for bountiful harvests, but that the practice has long since been abandoned. Because the wayward blade requires life energies for sustenance, the Cornservant suggests it stay in your company so as to feast on the life force of your fallen foes. The merchant readily surrenders the knife to your care before taking his leave, and the Cornservant believes now would be as good a time as any for you to become acquainted with your new traveling companion."

In any case, the rumbling of bellies has ceased, meaning it is time for the Cornservant to take their leave. They have every confidence the ritual blade will be safe in your capable hands─but will <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> be safe? Only time will tell..."
