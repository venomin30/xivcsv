1,"TEXT_KINGWK102_05254_SEQ_01","Having set you loose in the Moongate Hub with your exotablet and an instruction to “Go forth,” Searchingway is understandably curious as to your progress. Moments after you give a brief report on your activities, Namingway arrives, eager to share his newly crafted nomenclature in situ."
2,"TEXT_KINGWK102_05254_SEQ_02","When you indicate your willingness to hear more, Namingway urges you to accompany him first to the starship launch area, whence you will surely be guided hither and thither across Sinus Ardorum.

※You must be accompanied by Namingway to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_KINGWK102_05254_SEQ_03","You visit the fully constructed <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis> with Namingway in tow. Relishing the opportunity to recount the inspiration behind his creative choices, he dives into an explanation of the ship's propulsion system and its aspirational name."
4,"TEXT_KINGWK102_05254_SEQ_04","Your next destination is Gleamslope, so named in hopes that its sparkle will be visible during journeys to other stars. Notably, the tunnel that passes through it was carved without the use of magic, partly due to the magnetic interference in Sinus Ardorum, but also to test the efficacy of such a method on stars with limited aether."
5,"TEXT_KINGWK102_05254_SEQ_05","Last on your tour is Weddingway's Bower, a botanical garden lush with crossbred plants. Naturally, Namingway is prepared to explain the appellation given to each in greater detail, should anything in particular stand out to you."
6,"TEXT_KINGWK102_05254_SEQ_06","As your eyes scan over the hodgepodge garden, Namingway imparts tidbits of interest for each lunar species. From mycophlox to the sabotended, each has been lovingly─if somewhat eclectically─named."
7,"TEXT_KINGWK102_05254_SEQ_07","Having completed your tour of Sinus Ardorum's sights, you and Namingway report to Searchingway. He offers to guide you to one final vista─one overlooking the entire Moongate Hub. There, he confesses that the resolution of the Final Days left him unmoored from purpose, as it did many other Loporrits, but the scholars of Old Sharlayan inspired him to follow his curious heart. It was this epiphany that gave rise to the Cosmic Exploration Initiative and its headquarters, where a fully functional starship is now in want only of a destination...

The next quest will be available once you have completed 100 stellar missions in Sinus Ardorum. You may undertake missions and other cosmic exploration tasks from your exotablet."
