1,"TEXT_KINGRA205_05293_SEQ_01","Worried for the missing Neyuni, Yaana searches for her by tracking down her terminal's signal, and discovers that she has left Everkeep. After recent events, you cannot help but feel concerned for the young girl yourself, and so you agree to help Yaana search for any signs of her precocious sister in the vicinity of East Yyasulani, her terminal's coordinates."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA205_05293_SEQ_02","Breathing a sigh of relief, you find Neyuni safe and sound in East Yyasulani. The happy reunion is cut short, however, when Eutrope appears, revealing that summoning Neyuni had been a ploy to face you in the wild. After a brief clash between siblings, Yaana defeats her enfeebled sister, who is at last willing to speak candidly. Eutrope reveals that all the heavyweight fighters have already manifested psychonekrosis, yet continue to fight on, just like Retsarra─the Howling Blade. It was for his plight, and her heavyweight comrades, that she sought a cure. To her horror, however, it is at that moment that even Yaana experiences a bout of psychonekrosis-induced dizziness. An exasperated Neyuni takes this opportunity to mention her discovery of a potential cure to the disease─a stimulant which enhances an individual's “regeneration factor.” Now seeing the folly of her actions, Eutrope expresses her remorse to you before suddenly fainting."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA205_05293_SEQ_03","Resolved to save Retsarra from himself, Yaana has a plan she would enact: by utilizing Honey B. Lovely's star power, she conspires to have the unstoppable upstart and the Howling Blade agree to a wager with all of Alexandria watching. The stakes are high indeed─the loser of the upcoming match would be forced to retire. An audacious scheme, but whether the cruiserweight champion would agree to such a gamble remains to be seen. According to Yaana, you shall rendezvous with the sweet-but-deadly songstress at Mosaic, the lone wolf's haunt, to execute the plan."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA205_05293_SEQ_04","With a helping hand from the crowd─some of whom, as it turns out, were planted there by the redoubtable starlet to coax the champion─Yaana's scheme has borne fruit. Now, all that remains is to seize victory in the coming match.

※In the event that you leave the greenroom, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
5,"TEXT_KINGRA205_05293_SEQ_05","Offering some encouraging words, Yaana implores you to give the cruiserweight champion what for in the title match. With the Brute Bomber's tragic death still fresh in your memory, and countless others' hopes resting on your shoulders, you know this is a battle you must win."
