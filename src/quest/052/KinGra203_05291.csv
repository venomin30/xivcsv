0,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SEQ_00","Yaana is ready to introduce your next opponent."
1,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SEQ_01","Your next foe is to be Sugar Riot, a notorious graffiti artist-turned-Arcadion fighter. According to Yaana, the rambunctious rebel considers the ring her gallery, and you can expect the manifestations of her imagination to come forth within in boundless ways...

※AAC Cruiserweight M2 can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SEQ_02","Though Sugar Riot is every bit the artist you were expecting, when it comes to the arts of war, she proves no match for you. Yaana undoubtedly wishes to celebrate this latest triumph.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SEQ_03","Seizing the moment following your victories, Yaana informs Dancing Green and Sugar Riot about psychonekrosis. The pair are naturally taken aback, but after giving her words careful consideration, announce their intention to retire from the Arcadion. Yaana believes that an alternative outlet for their talents may have been key, as with Honey B. Lovely. For the Brute Bomber and the Howling Blade, however, the Arcadion is all they have, and Yaana appears to be at a loss as to how she can persuade them otherwise..."

50,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_101","A fighter who lives and breathes art, she uses the ring as her gallery─Sugar Riot!"
51,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_102","Before coming to the Arcadion, she was a graffiti artist, you see. Most of the graffiti you see in Solution Nine was either by her, or by those imitating her style."
52,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_103","By injecting herself with the soul of a deadly pudding, she's able to concoct special paint that can cause actual change to reality─even the ring itself."
53,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_104","To her, fighting is a medium for her art─a means of expressing herself. Her imagination is boundless, and you have to take care not to be overwhelmed, staying calm no matter what she throws at you."
54,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_105","If you can manage that, you'll surely overcome Sugar Riot, and continue on your way to the top of the cruiserweight division!"
55,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_110","I neglected to mention that the audience will be watching the match remotely. Sugar personally designed their avatars, so try and steal a glance when you can."
56,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_120","Well done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I knew you could do it!"
57,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_121","Your next match will be against the cruiserweight champion himself. But seeing as we have a bit of time, there's something I'd like to tend to first."
58,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_122","I want to tell Dancing Green and Sugar Riot about psychonekrosis, and see if they've developed any symptoms. We have to save them too if we can."
59,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_123","I've borrowed Neyuni's terminal, so we'll perform the examination here in this room. Rest assured I've already checked for listening devices."
60,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_124","The two should be here any moment now..."
61,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_DANCINGGREEN_100_124","So, what's this about, baby? Are we havin' a party here?"
62,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SUGARRIOT_100_125","If that's the case, I'll excuse myself. I'm rather keen to give form to the inspiration you've given me!"
63,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_125","While I'm relieved to say you haven't manifested the disease yet, you're both dangerously close to doing so. Just one more feral soul injection could push you beyond the brink. It would be wise to stop fighting in the Arcadion."
64,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_DANCINGGREEN_000_126","Whoa... Talk about a downer, baby..."
65,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SUGARRIOT_000_127","This is all very sudden, and I struggle to accept it. But for both you and Honey to retire...there must be truth to your words."
66,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_128","It's no easy thing to retire, I know. But for your own safety, I ask that you give it careful consideration."
67,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_DANCINGGREEN_000_129","I've made up my mind. I'll retire. This doesn't leave the room...but I've always struggled to play the part of Dancing Green."
68,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_DANCINGGREEN_000_130","To maintain the persona of a party animal, I've had to spend night after night out on the town. And when I'm not doing that, I'm practicing dance in the studio. It's utterly exhausting─soul-crushing..."
69,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_DANCINGGREEN_000_131","I pushed through it all because I didn't want to disappoint the fans, but this revelation sets me free. Dancing used to be my passion─perhaps I can learn to love it again."
70,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_132","I always thought you were a genuine party animal, living only to revel. To think that it was actually a burden on your shoulders..."
71,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SUGARRIOT_000_133","The ring has been my precious studio. It's saddening to think that I won't be able to step into it again."
72,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SUGARRIOT_000_134","But it was on the streets that I started plying my craft, and this revelation might be a sign telling me to go back to my roots."
73,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SUGARRIOT_000_135","So I'll do just that. I'll go back to a time when the whole city was my studio, and its walls my canvas!"
74,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_DANCINGGREEN_100_135","Truth be told, seeing you fight without a feral soul helped me realize that maybe, it's alright just to be myself."
75,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_136","I'm relieved. Thank you for listening."
76,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_SUGARRIOT_000_137","Well, we'd rather not die, of course. And it's you we have to thank for warning us."
77,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_DANCINGGREEN_100_137","We're liable to attract suspicion if we stay here too long. We'll discuss when to break the news to management at a later time."
78,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_137",""
79,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_200_137","Thankfully, those two have other places to employ their talents, like Honey."
80,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_000_138","To the Brute Bomber and the Howling Blade, however, the Arcadion is everything..."
81,"TEXT_KINGRA203_05291_YAANA_100_138","It isn't easy for them to retire─this, I know better than most. But it's a matter of life and death..."
