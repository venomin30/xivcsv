※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESESX002_05243_SEQ_01","Nonotta presents the prototype parasol to Jihli, who instantly expresses her approval. Having received the Dreamer's blessing, the Lalafell leaves to begin mass production. In the meantime, you agree to accompany a parasol-brandishing Jihli in search of potential Hatching–tide celebrants. Speak with her in Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre when you are ready to embark.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

※You must be accompanied by Jihli to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_FESESX002_05243_SEQ_03","Among the hustle and bustle of the market, you encounter three individuals with a discerning eye for eggs. Each proves more than willing to gather at the amphitheatre when promised a parasol of their own, and will no doubt spread word of the exciting accessory on their way."
4,"TEXT_FESESX002_05243_SEQ_04","Satisfied at having found sufficient celebrants, Jihli stows her parasol for the time being. She shares her intention to return to the amphitheatre to see how many have gathered, and invites you to join her at your leisure."
5,"TEXT_FESESX002_05243_SEQ_05","You return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to find a parasol-toting crowd gathered around the stage. As Jihli revels in the sight, Maisenta appears with the news that she, too, has been handing out parasols to those enamored with the ovoid accessories. Picturing delighted parasol bearers throughout the city, Nonotta suggests the scope of Jihli's vision has reached far beyond the amphitheatre, as it was perhaps always meant to do. Thrilled that the dream of myriad floating eggs has been fully realized, the pair repay your assistance with an Archon egg parasol of your very own. Duty done, you are free to enjoy the remainder of this year's Hatching–tide!"
