1,"TEXT_KINGRA206_05294_SEQ_01","Yaana explains that the Howling Blade was formerly a hunter before becoming a fighter. Employing the soul of the legendary wolf Fenrir in the ring, he complements his unparalleled swordsmanship with extraordinary speed. To save the lone wolf's life, you must best him in battle─and that shall be no trifling task.

※AAC Cruiserweight M4 can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA206_05294_SEQ_02","After evading a veritable squall of swift slashes and magicks both tempestuous and seismic, you have cornered the wolf and seized victory. Yaana will doubtlessly be overjoyed by your accomplishment.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA206_05294_SEQ_03","A dejected Howling Blade joins you and Yaana in the greenroom, and asks how he is to go on without his career as a fighter. Frustrated, Yaana explains to him how blind he has been, ignoring the suffering of his dearest friend, and that of his beloved. Her words strike a chord in his heart, helping him to finally accept the truth he refused to acknowledge─that the president must be stopped. Retiring his ring name, Retsarra now intends to join you at Tritails Training to chart your next course of action."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA206_05294_SEQ_04","Upon returning to the gym, you discover that Neyuni and Eutrope are nowhere to be seen. On cue, the voice of the president emanates from the monitor, revealing why: due to your acts of spreading information regarding psychonekrosis and convincing other fighters to retire, the megalomaniac executive has seen fit to abduct Yaana's sisters. Should you veer from his so-called script again, the pair may come to harm, and thus your only path forward is clear: you must become grand champion of the Ascension Arcadia Championship. Before he ends the transmission, the president mentions the stimulant Neyuni discovered in her research, officially known as the Drop of Life. Ascend to the top, and he promises to divulge its location."
5,"TEXT_KINGRA206_05294_SEQ_05","A crestfallen Yaana broods in silence outside Tritails Training. Finally, she speaks, reiterating her faith in you, with hope that you will return to compete in the heavyweight matches and see to whatever preparations necessary before they begin. For not only her sisters' sakes, but that of countless others, the unstoppable upstart must press on, and keep fighting the good fight."
