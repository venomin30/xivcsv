※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_SEQ_01","Jihli Aliapoh shares with you her vision for this year's Hatching–tide celebration, which involves a clutch of improbably floating eggs delighting crowds with their festive whimsy. Alas, the decorations commissioned to recreate her dream were shattered in an unfortunate cart incident. Determined to salvage the situation, she and Nonotta enlist your help in crafting another batch.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_SEQ_02","Though Nonotta's supplier is fresh out of egg components, he takes pity on your plight and gifts you a crate of surplus materials. After inspecting the contents, Nonotta seizes on the idea of creating a set of egg-shaped parasols. To prevent further delay of the festivities, you agree to beg help from the local guilds to craft the necessary parts."
3,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_SEQ_03","Hoping to see the Hatching–tide celebrations go ahead as planned, Geva pledges the guild's assistance. In return, she asks that you provide the water-repellent solution required to turn leather into durable parasol canopies. Already in possession of the necessary ingredients, Nonotta leaves to make arrangements, but not before tasking you with delivering timber to the Carpenters' Guild. Planks in hand, you set off to see Beatin."
4,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_SEQ_04","Once apprised of the situation, the timbermaster too agrees to aid your cause. Safe in the knowledge that the lumber you delivered will be sawn and lathed into parasol parts with all due care, you make for the Black Rabbit Traders' stall where Nonotta awaits."
5,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_SEQ_05","The Lalafellin Dreamer explains that she has arranged to have the appropriate alchemical solution concocted, and ordered some extra accoutrements besides. No doubt Jihli will be keen to hear of your progress while you wait for Nonotta to arrive with the finished prototype."
6,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_SEQ_06","You inform Jihli of your efforts thus far, and explain the plan to substitute the original eggs with festive parasols. With the guilds crafting the components and Nonotta handling the logistics, the first phase of parasol preparation draws to a close."

54,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_032","I have been visited by such dreams ever since, and this year was no exception. I saw a great mass of eggs, as vivid as those before you now, borne aloft unto the heavens..."
55,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_033","Making dreams manifest has never failed to lend wonder to Hatching–tide before, so needless to say, I intend to bring my latest vision to life."

98,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_GEVA_000_220","Trust that your leather is in capable hands."

105,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_BEATINE_000_250","Parasol frames? A task not beyond your own skill, no doubt, would the imminence of the holiday not force you to compromise their quality. You have done well to seek aid, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and you shall have it."
106,"TEXT_FESESX001_05242_BEATINE_000_260","And you would have us undertake this task with <Emphasis>how</Emphasis> little time left until Hatching–tide? <sigh> Very well..."
