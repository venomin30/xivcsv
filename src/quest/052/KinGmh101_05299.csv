0,"TEXT_KINGMH101_05299_SEQ_00","Krile wishes to catch up on recent events."
1,"TEXT_KINGMH101_05299_SEQ_01","In the Backroom, you are briefed on recent events by several Scion associates, as well as your Alexandrian and Tuliyollan allies. Wuk Lamat, for her part, has decided to stay in Alexandria until the mystery of the new Sphene has been unraveled, and on this subject, you learn that the Queen of Reason has often been sighted around the city, urging her citizens to become Endless. Curiously, those who still wear regulators appear to have no memory of her death. However, while these developments are cause for concern, it appears there is a more pressing matter. A guest has been brought to the Backroom, and Krile bids you visit the break room, where Y'shtola and Alisaie even now attend to them."
2,"TEXT_KINGMH101_05299_SEQ_02","The break room can be accessed through a door located in the corner of the Backroom. You need but cross the threshold to meet the mysterious guest who awaits.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return from the Backroom in Solution Nine."
3,"TEXT_KINGMH101_05299_SEQ_03","You follow the hallway to a small sleeping area, and upon one of the beds you see a woman who looks strikingly familiar. Y'shtola reveals that she is the original, still-living Queen Sphene, whom she and Shale found wandering Living Memory during their investigation of the area. Upon bringing her to Solution Nine, they decided to treat the aetheric imbalance in her body with a porxie. As you digest this turn of events, Sphene opens her eyes, reacting with confusion before slowly regaining her senses. Y'shtola informs the former queen of her centuries-long slumber, yet this is but the first of many revelations she must receive."
4,"TEXT_KINGMH101_05299_SEQ_04","Joined by G'raha Tia and Krile, you and the others discuss with Sphene the four hundred years that have passed since she was placed in deep sleep. The conversation is long, but afterwards Sphene is grateful for everyone's patience. Even so, it is plain she still wrestles with the newfound knowledge of her situation and the home she has lost. Sensing her discomfort, Gulool Ja suggests going out into the city, so Sphene can see what modern Alexandria is like, and Wuk Lamat heartily agrees."
5,"TEXT_KINGMH101_05299_SEQ_05","Sphene seems excited by the prospect of exploration and the opportunity to become acquainted with you and your allies. In the meantime, you prepare to serve as escort to Alexandria's new guest."
