1,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_SEQ_01","In the midst of your hiatus from the Arcadion, you find Yaana in front of her gym, and are pleasantly surprised to discover that she has been hoping to see you. She remarks that though cruiserweight matches have yet to begin, she and Neyuni have made a breakthrough in their research about psychonekrosis. It seems they would share it with you inside."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_SEQ_02","Neyuni reveals that after a failed attempt to access Everkeep's core systems, she was furnished with data from Origenics courtesy of Oblivion, and has discovered a means to evaluate the condition of one's soul. Equipped with such knowledge, Yaana would examine her comrades in the light-heavyweight division to determine if they have been afflicted with psychonekrosis. Having received your blessing to do so, she wastes no time in contacting Honey B. Lovely, her senior at the Arcadion."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_SEQ_03","Honey is shocked by your revelation, and is all too happy to retire from the Arcadion, declaring she will pursue a new avenue for her talents. Relieved that Honey was more understanding than anticipated, Yaana states there is one more whom she would inform and examine: the Brute Bomber. Together, you set off for the place of his dwelling, residential radius 9-11."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_SEQ_04","Upon entering his apartment, the peculiar sight of the Brute Bomber surrounded by a trio of adorable kittens meets your eyes. Beside him stands the Howling Blade, his childhood friend, who informs you that the pair owe the president of the Arcadion a debt of gratitude they can never repay. Carefully reading the air, he takes his leave, allowing Yaana to reveal the dire cost of using feral souls to the Brute Bomber. You are already too late, however, as Neyuni's examination indicates his soul already shows signs of the affliction. The diagnosis is proven true not a moment later when the Brute Bomber suffers from a severe bout of dizziness, a symptom of the disease. Yet in spite of the mounting evidence and Yaana's earnest warnings, he remains in denial. The three of you depart his room with faint hope he will have a change of heart."
5,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_SEQ_05","With yet another person stricken by the disease, Yaana and Neyuni are resolved to find a cure as soon as possible. You are interrupted in the midst of your deliberations by a call from Metem, who relays that cruiserweight matches are soon to begin. Having been summoned to meet him in the greenroom of the Arcadion, Neyuni vows to continue researching a cure while you and Yaana focus on winning your upcoming matches."
6,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_SEQ_06","The Arcadion attendant welcomes you cordially, and graciously guides you through the facility's familiar halls to the greenroom.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion."
7,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_SEQ_07","No sooner do you enter the room than a boisterous playboy pops open a bottle of champagne, ostensibly in celebration of your arrival. Taken aback, you turn looking for Metem, and instead spot a conspicuous lass vandalizing the room with graffiti. The colorful pair greet you before suddenly departing, and Metem informs you that they shall be your opponents in the cruiserweight tier."
8,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_SEQ_08","The time has come to begin your cruiserweight campaign. Yaana implores you to psych yourself up for the coming matches, as each of your rivals wield more potent souls─and greater power─than your foes in the light-heavyweight tier."

51,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_010","Before diving into the details, perhaps a refresher is in order. It's a rather complicated affair, after all..."
52,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_100_010","You had barely been crowned champion of the light-heavyweight division before our sister, Eutrope, challenged you. She was intent on claiming your soul as a means to cure psychonekrosis."
53,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_100_011","The illness appears to afflict those who use feral souls to an excessive degree─those such as Arcadion fighters."
54,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_100_012","We learned from Eutrope that the immortalized, who we thought lived in luxury in the upper levels, are actually dead─taken by the disease."
55,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_NEYUNI_100_013","Since that revelation, we've looked for alternate ways to cure psychonekrosis, and we finally have some news to share."
56,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_011","It's all thanks to Neyuni. Like Eutrope, she has a sense for electrope technology. She's learned to do all sorts of things from tinkering on her own."
57,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_NEYUNI_000_012","Oh Yaana, don't give <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> the wrong idea. It's the people of Oblivion that we have to thank for our discoveries. I had attempted to access Everkeep's core systems for information on souls, you see..."
58,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_NEYUNI_000_013","Unsurprisingly, I failed. What's more, an Oblivion member who was monitoring unauthorized access found me."

60,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_NEYUNI_000_014","When I explained our predicament, however, she kindly shared research data Oblivion had acquired from Origenics. The data was quite difficult to parse, but I managed to find some relevant information."
61,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_NEYUNI_000_015","Namely, that the military was well aware of psychonekrosis, having also sought to utilize feral souls. Furthermore, they had developed a method to identify the presence of the affliction."
62,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_016","This brings us to our next move. Now that we're privy to this method, we feel that we should use it to diagnose other fighters. They deserve to know if they're ill."

64,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_A2_000_001","Indeed. It isn't right to leave them ignorant."
65,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_A2_000_002","It would be risky to alert them."
66,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_017","I'm glad you agree. I can't sit idly by knowing that they might die."
67,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_018","Yes, very. That's why we came to you before taking action."
68,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_019","As Metem warned us, the president doesn't take kindly to those who get in his way. He'd be extremely unimpressed if we revealed the secret to those you've yet to fight, and caused their withdrawal."
69,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_020","Of course, you're still liable to incur the president's ire by becoming grand champion and releasing all the souls in the repository. But we should avoid getting in his crosshairs for as long as we can."
70,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_021","That's why I propose we approach only those fighters you've already bested. As they're barred from fighting for a time, it wouldn't have an immediate impact on the championship."
71,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_100_021","There are still risks, however. Every time our fellow fighters use a feral soul, they bring themselves closer to psychonekrosis─including in a match against you. "
72,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_022","Which is why it's important we tell them the truth as soon as possible. So we can stop that from happening for good."

85,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_NEYUNI_000_030","Yaana was so eager to prove herself, she utilized feral souls numerous times when training. So when I examined her, we found that she's on the threshold of developing the disease."
86,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_HONEYBLOVELY_000_031","For mercy's sake, Yaana! We're forbidden from training with feral souls! ...And knowing what I know now, I'd say it's because the president doesn't want us to die too early. It'd be bad for entertainment."
87,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_032","At any rate, neither of us should use feral souls again. Which means we can't fight in the Arcadion anymore..."
88,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_HONEYBLOVELY_000_033","Alright, then! I'll retire!"
89,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_YAANA_000_034","R-Really!? I wasn't expecting you to decide so quickly..."
90,"TEXT_KINGRA201_05289_HONEYBLOVELY_000_035","While I've graced countless magazine covers and concert stages, I never shined so brightly as when I fought in the ring, it's true."
