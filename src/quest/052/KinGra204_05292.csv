1,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_SEQ_01","While Yaana remains gravely concerned for her fellow fighters, for now she turns her attention to preparations for the upcoming title match. To that end, she asks you to accompany her back to Tritails Training."
2,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_SEQ_02","Upon entering the gym, you see a broadcast of the Brute Bomber issuing you a challenge. Metem soon rushes into the room, explaining that the president has granted the vile heat a grudge match with you on the condition that he employs multiple feral souls. Such an act could potentially be lethal, yet the president's word is absolute to the former champion, and so you have no recourse but to face the reckless heel. Once you have seen to your preparations, a chauffeur awaits at the Arcadion to deliver you to the battlefield."
3,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_SEQ_03","After informing you that Ascension Arcadia has made various preparations for the battle of its own, the chauffeur delivers you to your destination.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion chauffeur in front of the Arcadion."
4,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_SEQ_04","You arrive at the venue to find the Brute Bomber waiting. Yaana pleads for him to abandon his plan to inject himself with multiple feral souls, unfortunately to no avail. The chimerical creature which forms before your eyes bears no resemblance to the man who formerly stood before you, and Metem quickly observes this fact by declaring the man-turned-monster the Brute Abombinator. His life hangs in the balance, and if you are to keep your promise to Yaana, you shall need to fight harder than ever before in this vengeful showdown.

※AAC Cruiserweight M3 can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
5,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_SEQ_05","In the battle to stop your transfigured foe, you have not only survived being flung across buildings, but being smashed into them as well. Now, you have only to await Yaana and Metem's arrival.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion chauffeur in front of the Arcadion."
6,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_SEQ_06","By the time Yaana reaches you, it is clear that psychonekrosis has already claimed the Brute Bomber's life. With the president still furious that his secret has been revealed, Metem departs in hopes of pacifying his anger. No sooner does he leave than the Howling Blade arrives. Mourning the untimely passing of his dearest friend, he reveals that he too suffers from the affliction, and intends to continue down his path as an Arcadion fighter─even if the sole destination is death."
7,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_SEQ_07","Frustrated that she was unable to convince the Brute Bomber and the Howling Blade not to throw their lives away, Yaana's exasperation reaches a boiling point. When she has regained some calm, she notices that Neyuni is nowhere to be seen, and you, too, are left to wonder where the young girl might have gone..."

53,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_METEM_000_103","This is unbelievable, folks! Just when we thought the Brute Bomber couldn't sink any lower, it seems he now intends to use unregulated feral souls─and several of them at once besides! The madman's going turn himself into an abombination!"

57,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_YAANA_000_107","That idiot! Instead of listening to us, he goes and does <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>!?"
58,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_NEYUNI_000_108","The general public is unaware, but the “doping” tonic the Brute Bomber imbibes during his matches is actually a harmless prop he uses as part of his ring persona."
59,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_NEYUNI_000_109","That's why his matches continue even when he's disqualified. Using multiple feral souls at once, however, is expressly forbidden due to the extreme danger it poses."
60,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_NEYUNI_000_110","Doing so warps the flesh irreversibly─turns you into an abomination, as Mister Metem said. And in the worst case, it will kill you."
61,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_NEYUNI_000_111","This is likely because it greatly accelerates the soul's degradation, leading to psychonekrosis..."

64,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_METEM_000_114","Well, he ended up taking the matter to the president, who naturally denied the existence of the disease. And naturally, the Brute Bomber chose to believe him."
65,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_METEM_000_115","That's not all. The president has sanctioned a grudge match between him and you─on one condition."
66,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_METEM_000_116","In order to stand a chance, he has to inject multiple feral souls for the fight."
67,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_METEM_000_117","I made a great fuss on the broadcast about his use of unregulated feral souls, but it's all staged. Everything is according to the president's script. He wants to get rid of you, and he's using the Brute Bomber to do so!"
68,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_YAANA_000_118","What!? But the Brute Bomber's already exhibiting symptoms of psychonekrosis! This will kill him!"
69,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_METEM_000_119","I know... I tried to talk him out of it as well, but he refused to listen. For him, the president's orders are absolute."
70,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_METEM_000_120","Make no mistake, the match <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> go ahead. Even should you ignore his challenge, the Brute Bomber will inject himself with his assembled feral souls and come for you."
71,"TEXT_KINGRA204_05292_METEM_000_121","Besides, if you still intend to become grand champion and release all the souls in the Arcadion's repository, I fear there's no way except through this fight."
