1,"TEXT_KINGBZ002_05189_SEQ_01","Luckily, the Unbound agent informs you that the next test is your last, and will be conducted by Apyaahi herself. However, it seems a flight of fancy has taken her to the Sagolii Desert, so it is there that you must seek her out to undertake your final trial."
2,"TEXT_KINGBZ002_05189_SEQ_02","You cast your gaze across the sand dunes and are alarmed by the disturbing sight of Apyaahi seemingly taming a staggering sand worm. You approach the solitary Viera, and when you explain your purpose, she readily accepts your petition for leadership. Apparently the trial is to be held in the middle of the desert."
3,"TEXT_KINGBZ002_05189_SEQ_03","Apyaahi questions you on your motivations for wanting to join her, and shares with you the desire for freedom that caused her to form the Passage of the Unbound. She soon asks you to follow her deeper into the desert, but warns you to watch for any hungry beasts."
4,"TEXT_KINGBZ002_05189_SEQ_04","As you traverse the wastes, you see Apyaahi being accosted by a trio of sandrakes. She takes this opportunity to hold your practical exam, and you handily beat the beasts into submission. Apyaahi gazes at you with a look of appraisal."
5,"TEXT_KINGBZ002_05189_SEQ_05","It seems your might has met with Apyaahi's approval. She beckons you to follow her further─hopefully you will not attract the attention of any more hungry creatures."
6,"TEXT_KINGBZ002_05189_SEQ_06","At the summit of a tall dune, you and Apyaahi gaze upon the starry sky. After unceremoniously revealing that you have passed the final trial, she tells you about the search for freedom that led her to Tural and the Yok Huy spirit who gave her the treasure she wields. She then welcomes you as one of her leaders with a pose of dubious meaning, and spares you a moment to appreciate the weight of your grand achievement."
7,"TEXT_KINGBZ002_05189_SEQ_07","Apyaahi instructs you to master the pose she performed and once again welcomes you into the Passage of the Unbound. With your induction complete, you draw one step closer to finding out what Apyaahi has in store for the world."

83,"TEXT_KINGBZ002_05189_APYAAHI_000_208","My village prospered amid nature unrestrained, while those in it were bound by the rules of society. Our roles were determined at birth. Some would hunt, some would weave...but none were allowed to follow their hearts!"
