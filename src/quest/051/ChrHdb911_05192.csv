1,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_01","Following a lead from the pages of <Emphasis>The Thavnairian Truth</Emphasis>, Nashu Mhakaracca has come west in search of the once more involuntarily displaced inspector. Her tentative plan is to interrogate local residents for sightings of the errant starship in an attempt to divine the missing Manderville man's current location. To that end, she has handed you a visual aid─an illustration of said starship─and enlisted you to expand the range of the investigation. The Landsguard stationed at Brightploom Post may be best equipped to handle any questions regarding unusual airborne vessels."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_02","You have gathered some reliable starship sightings from the Landsguard. Nashu will wish to hear of your findings back at the markets."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_03","Although Nashu herself discovered little amongst the stalls of Bayside Bevy (aside from a taste for several local delicacies), she is impressed by your successful investigative efforts. Based on the information provided by the city guard, you move your search northwards to the dome-enclosed Heritage Found."
4,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_04","Having arrived in the location where the starship supposedly went down, Nashu suggests shifting the focus to tracking down the inspector himself. Surely one of the residents has sighted your gentlemanly quarry?"
5,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_05","One resident of the outskirts insists that no man of Hildibrand's description would have escaped his notice in such a tight-knit community. Enamored by the suggestion to seek the inspector in “Solution” Nine, Nashu immediately makes her way over to the mechanical sentry at the tower's entrance."
6,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_06","The sentry verifies your unlimited access to Everkeep, but sounds the alarm upon detecting materials of an explosive nature upon Nashu's person. Her subsequent nonsensical explanation appears to overload the logic circuits of every nearby unit, allowing you to enter Solution Nine without further challenge."
7,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_07","Nashu reasons that the best way to find the inspector is to locate an ongoing case, for that is where a gentlemanly agent of enquiry is most likely to be. You head off to True Vue, the liveliest part of town, to ask after any potential incidents or mysteries."
8,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_08","Your inquiries are met with the news of a recent theft which, conveniently for you, occurred not far from where you now stand. This sounds like just the kind of case Nashu was hoping for."
9,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_09","Nashu, too, has heard the details of the robbery, and you both head off to the scene of the crime. There you witness the detective work of a man who very much resembles Inspector Hildibrand, though his garb and speech seem that of an entirely different person. Nashu is nevertheless confident that he is the missing inspector, theorizing that the man's ungentlemanly manner is the result of shock from the crash. Although adamant that a healthy dose of her “medicine” will put him to rights, she heeds your call for restraint and settles for following the man in the overcoat from a distance...for now."
10,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_10","After foiling Nashu's first attempt to “treat” him, the man in the overcoat denies being any sort of gentleman inspector, instead introducing himself as Detective Hardiboiled. While a second round of treatment (this time disguised as a hard-boiled egg) confirms the characteristic uncanny Manderville indestructibility, his pulpy demeanor nevertheless remains unchanged. This fact, along with the physical resemblance, leads you to suspect he shares a soul with the Hildibrand of the Source. Though confused and a little disappointed, Nashu concedes that you likely have the wrong man. The detective, for his part, is intrigued by your talk of a missing person, and Nashu eagerly accepts his offer to work on the case."
11,"TEXT_CHRHDB911_05192_SEQ_11","Nashu opts to curtail her own investigations for a time, still feeling overwhelmed by the futuristic city of Solution Nine. It seems you are free to return to your usual activities until Detective Hardiboiled makes a break in the case."
