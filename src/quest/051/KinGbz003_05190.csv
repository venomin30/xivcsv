2,"TEXT_KINGBZ003_05190_SEQ_02","Troubled yet unsurprised by your news, Rral Majun and Br'uk Evu have tidings of their own to share: a familiar group of allies has but recently arrived in the city. As if summoned by this remark, your five companions during the search for the treasures walk into Xbalyav Ty'e. Apparently, they just returned from following a suspicious group from Tuliyollal to Shaaloani, and surmise that they may very well be the enforcers Apyaahi intends for you to meet. Ceetol Ja suggests splitting up, with her group going to Shaaloani to find out the details of Apyaahi's plan, and the other working to uncover the secrets of her treasure. Kuiyki asks to join her on her trek to Shaaloani, and apparently has a plan that will make the mission easier─which of course, involves you."
3,"TEXT_KINGBZ003_05190_SEQ_03","Kuiyki reveals that she has the Dreamweave Cocoon with her, which will allow you to mimic Apyaahi's form and demand information from her minions. With your plan settled, the three of you depart to Hhusatahwi."
4,"TEXT_KINGBZ003_05190_SEQ_04","At the saloon in Hhusatahwi, Kuiyki gives you the Dreamweave Cocoon, and instructs you to imagine Apyaahi's features. You close your eyes and concentrate, and when you open them, you look down to see you've successfully taken on the form of the vixen Viera. Putting on your best impression of a whimsical villainess, you enter the saloon and approach the shady-looking men.

※If the transfiguration should fade, speak with Kuiyki again to be changed back into Apyaahi."

Eventually, they mention something about how she plans to build an army, but before they can elucidate further, Ceetol Ja calls you by linkshell and informs you that the real Apyaahi is soon to enter the saloon. You quickly change back into your original form and meet the Viera downstairs, who seems ready to enact her plot at any moment. Apyaahi goes to meet her cohorts, while you rush to Ceetol Ja to share your findings."
7,"TEXT_KINGBZ003_05190_SEQ_07","Relieved that you were able to extract information from the enforcers before Apyaahi interrupted you, Ceetol Ja tells you that Tentoawa and the others have but recently arrived, and can be found out of sight some distance from the aetheryte."
